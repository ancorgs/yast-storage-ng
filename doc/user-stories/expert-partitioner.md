# Introduction

This document describes the expert partitioner behavior using specs. The idea is to document all the functionalities of the expert partitioner with a similar format that we would obtain as rspec output. Note: these specs have been done manually, they are not the result of a real rspec test.

The specs are based on current version of expert partitioner for TW. The goal is to know and understand the gap between old and new expert partitioners. Missing parts in the new expert partitioner are marked as *pending* along the document.
