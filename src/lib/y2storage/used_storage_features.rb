module Y2Storage
  #
  # Class that collects information about which storage features are used
  # in the current target machine's storage setup so add-on packages can be
  # marked for installation as needed.
  #
  # Usage:
  #
  #   # Create or obtain a device graph, e.g. with
  #   devicegraph = Y2Storage::StorageManager.instance.probed
  #
  #   used_features = Y2Storage::UsedStorageFeatures.new(devicegraph)
  #   pkg_list = used_features.feature_packages
  #
  class UsedStorageFeatures

    # Any map value may be a string, a list of strings, or 'nil'.
    #
    # Packages that are part of a minimal installation (e.g., "util-linux")
    # are not listed here.
    #
